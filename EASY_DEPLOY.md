# Easy Deployment Guide for Eterna

This guide helps you deploy Eterna to Render, Vercel, Railway, or other platforms without dependency issues.

## 🚀 Quick Deploy Options

### Option 1: Deploy to Render (Recommended - Full Stack with Redis)

[![Deploy to Render](https://render.com/images/deploy-to-render-button.svg)](https://render.com)

**Steps:**

1. **Fork/Clone this repository** to your GitHub account

2. **Go to Render Dashboard** (https://dashboard.render.com)

3. **Click "New +" → "Blueprint"**
   - Connect your GitHub repository
   - Render will automatically detect `render.yaml`
   - Click "Apply"

4. **Wait for deployment** (3-5 minutes)
   - Backend will be deployed
   - Redis instance will be created
   - Environment variables will be set automatically

5. **Access your app** at the provided URL

**Manual Setup (Alternative):**

1. Create a **Redis** instance:
   - Click "New +" → "Redis"
   - Name: `eterna-redis`
   - Plan: Free
   - Copy the Internal Redis URL

2. Create a **Web Service**:
   - Click "New +" → "Web Service"
   - Connect your repository
   - Select branch: `copilot/add-ui-for-token-data-visualization` (or your main branch)
   - Settings:
     - **Name**: `eterna-backend`
     - **Environment**: Node
     - **Build Command**: `npm ci && npm run build`
     - **Start Command**: `node dist/index.js`
     - **Plan**: Free

3. Set **Environment Variables**:
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   REDIS_URL=<paste-redis-internal-url>
   PORT=10000
   ```

4. Click **"Create Web Service"** and wait for deployment

### Option 2: Deploy to Railway (Easy with Free Credits)

[![Deploy on Railway](https://railway.app/button.svg)](https://railway.app)

**Steps:**

1. **Go to Railway** (https://railway.app)

2. **Click "Start a New Project"**
   - Select "Deploy from GitHub repo"
   - Choose your repository

3. **Add Redis Database**:
   - Click "New" → "Database" → "Add Redis"
   - Railway auto-sets `REDIS_URL`

4. **Add Environment Variables**:
   - Click on your service → "Variables"
   - Add:
     ```
     NODE_ENV=production
     PORT=3000
     CACHE_TTL=30
     REFRESH_INTERVAL=30
     ```

5. **Generate Domain**:
   - Settings → "Generate Domain"

6. **Access your app** at the generated domain

---

### Option 3: Deploy to Vercel (Serverless - No Redis)

⚠️ **Note**: Vercel is serverless, so Redis caching won't work, but the app will still function.

**Steps:**

1. **Install Vercel CLI** (optional):
   ```bash
   npm i -g vercel
   ```

2. **Deploy from GitHub**:
   - Go to https://vercel.com
   - Click "Import Project"
   - Select your repository
   - Vercel will auto-detect settings from `vercel.json`
   - Click "Deploy"

3. **Set Environment Variables** (in Vercel dashboard):
   ```
   NODE_ENV=production
   CACHE_TTL=30
   REFRESH_INTERVAL=30
   ```

4. **Access your app** at the provided Vercel URL

**Using CLI:**
```bash
cd /path/to/Eterna
vercel --prod
```

## 🔧 Pre-Deployment Checklist

Before deploying, ensure:

- [x] All dependencies are listed in `package.json` ✅
- [x] TypeScript is in dependencies (not devDependencies) ✅
- [x] Build scripts are properly configured ✅
- [x] Node version is specified in `engines` ✅
- [x] Environment variables are documented ✅
- [x] Frontend build is integrated ✅

---

## 📋 Environment Variables Reference

| Variable | Required | Default | Description |
|----------|----------|---------|-------------|
| `NODE_ENV` | Yes | production | Set to "production" for deployment |
| `PORT` | Platform-specific | 3000 | Server port (Render uses 10000) |
| `REDIS_URL` | No | - | Redis connection string (optional) |
| `CACHE_TTL` | No | 30 | Cache time-to-live in seconds |
| `REFRESH_INTERVAL` | No | 30 | Data refresh interval in seconds |
| `DEXSCREENER_RATE_LIMIT` | No | 300 | API requests per minute |
| `JUPITER_RATE_LIMIT` | No | 600 | API requests per minute |
| `GECKOTERMINAL_RATE_LIMIT` | No | 300 | API requests per minute |

## 🔍 Troubleshooting Deployment Issues

### Issue: npm ci error "can only install with an existing package-lock.json"

**Root Cause:** The `package-lock.json` file is required for `npm ci` to work.

**Solution:**
✅ **Already Fixed** - `package-lock.json` files are now included in the repository for both backend and frontend.

If you cloned before this fix:
```bash
git pull origin copilot/add-ui-for-token-data-visualization
```

The deployment will now work correctly with `npm ci`.

### Issue: Render shows "Cannot find module '/opt/render/project/src/dist/index.js'"

**This was a common Render deployment error (now fixed).**

**Root Cause:** The build was skipped or the `dist` directory wasn't created.

**Solution:**

1. **Check Build Command** in Render dashboard:
   - Should be: `npm ci && npm run build`
   - NOT: `npm install` or `echo "Skipping..."`

2. **Verify Build Logs**:
   - Look for "Running build command"
   - Should see TypeScript compilation output
   - Should see "Build successful"

3. **Manual Fix**:
   - Go to Render Dashboard → Your Service
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Clear build cache & deploy"
   - This forces a fresh build

4. **Check render.yaml** (should have):
   ```yaml
   buildCommand: npm ci && npm run build
   startCommand: node dist/index.js
   ```

5. **Local Test**:
   ```bash
   # Test the exact build process Render will use
   rm -rf node_modules dist frontend/build
   npm ci
   npm run build
   ls dist/  # Should see index.js
   node dist/index.js  # Should start without errors
   ```

### Issue: "Module not found" or dependency errors

**Solution:**
1. Ensure `typescript` is in `dependencies` (not `devDependencies`) ✅ Fixed
2. Clear build cache and redeploy
3. Ensure `package-lock.json` is committed ✅ Fixed

### Issue: Build fails with "Cannot find module"

**Solution:**
```bash
# Locally test the build process
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

### Issue: Frontend not loading in production

**Solution:**
1. Verify build command includes frontend: `npm run build`
2. Check that `frontend/build` directory exists after build
3. Ensure backend serves static files from `frontend/build`

### Issue: Redis connection error

**Solution:**
- **If using Render/Railway**: Check that Redis instance is created and `REDIS_URL` is set
- **If using Vercel**: Redis won't work (serverless). App functions without it.
- App will still work without Redis, just without caching

### Issue: Port already in use

**Solution:**
Most platforms set `PORT` automatically. Don't hardcode port 3000.
```javascript
// Already handled in code
const port = process.env.PORT || 3000;
```

### Issue: WebSocket connection fails

**Solution:**
1. Ensure platform supports WebSocket (Render, Railway ✅, Vercel ⚠️ limited)
2. For HTTPS deployments, frontend should use `wss://` instead of `ws://`
3. Check CORS settings allow your frontend domain

---

## ✅ Post-Deployment Verification

1. **Test Health Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app-url.com/api/health
   ```
   Expected: `{"success":true,"data":{"status":"ok",...}}`

2. **Test Tokens Endpoint**:
   ```bash
   curl https://your-app-url.com/api/tokens?limit=5
   ```
   Expected: Token data array

3. **Test Frontend**:
   - Open `https://your-app-url.com` in browser
   - Should see Eterna UI with token cards
   - Check that WebSocket connects (green "Live" indicator)

4. **Check Logs**:
   - **Render**: Dashboard → Logs
   - **Railway**: Project → Deployments → Logs
   - **Vercel**: Dashboard → Functions → Logs
